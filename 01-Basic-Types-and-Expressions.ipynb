    "\n",
    "* A **statically typed** language that runs on the JVM.\n",
    "* Provides both **_functional_** and **_object-oriented_** constructs.  We will go over these during today's workshop.\n",
    "* Provides a rich, expressive type system.\n",
    "* The language and its ecosystem facilitate development of concurrent, non-blocking services.\n",
    "* **Who**: Martin Odersky \n",
    "* **When**: Publicly released in 2004\n",

    "## What is the JVM?\n",

    "* Java Virtual Machine: A specification and abstract machine that runs Java bytecode.\n",
    "* Bytecode is a _platform-independent_, intermediate representation.  Java, Groovy, Scala, and Clojure compilers produce bytecode.\n",
