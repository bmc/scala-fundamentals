    "- You can use `@BeanProperty` if you need JavaBeans setters and getters.\n",

    "### Properties (Fields) with getters and setters\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing Java classes, we tend to avoid public fields. For instance, the following is considered to be bad Java code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Person { // This is Java, not Scala\n",
    "    public int age;\n",
    "    public String name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this approach is its inflexibility. If you publish this class, callers will access `age` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Person fred = new Person();\n",
    "fred.name = \"Fred\";\n",
    "fred.age = 21;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what if we want to ensure that a caller does not make a person younger? To do that in Java, we have to change the public interface of the class\n",
    "to add a setter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, when programming Java, we defensively write setters and getters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Person {\n",
    "    private int age;\n",
    "    private String name;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public int getAge() { return age; }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void setAge(int newAge) {\n",
    "        // Now we can add some checks.\n",
    "        if (newAge > this.age)\n",
    "            this.age = newAge;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public String getName() { return name; }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void setName(String newName) { this.name = newName; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    - You start out with public fields.\n",
