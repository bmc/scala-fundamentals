    "# Scala Fundamentals: Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala is a hybrid language, incorporating both object-oriented and functional programming design patterns.\n",
    "As befits a language with functional aspects, _functions_ are very important constructs. In this lesson,\n",
    "we'll discuss functions (and, occasionally, _methods_). Along the way, we'll point out differences between\n",
    "Scala's functions and those in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One concise definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [useful definition of a function](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/functions.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Functions are \"self-contained\" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually\n",
    "> _take in_ data, process it, and _return_ a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we discussed blocks. In a way, you can think of a function as a block that takes\n",
    "arguments â€” a _parameterized block_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions are _invoked_ with one or more arguments.\n",
    "- Functions return results. (A function that doesn't return a result is a _procedure_, and procedures typically\n",
    "  have side effects.)\n",
    "- A Scala function has a parameter list, a body, and a result type.\n",
    "- Scala function definitions start with the keyword `def`."

    "- Scala function return type comes at the end of the function definition, not at the beginning.\n",
    "- Scala does not require the `return` keyword. The last value computed by the function is always returned.\n",
    "- The equals sign is _required_. <sup>*</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>*</sup>Older versions of Scala permitted the definition of procedures (functions without a return value) by omitting the `=`. This syntax\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we introduced the concept of _referential transparency_. Recall our definition:\n",

    "> An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.\n",

    "If we have an expression $x + y$, and we assign it to variable $z$, we get the function $z = x + y$. \n",

    "**For a function to be referentially transparent, anywhere the expression x + y exists could be replaced by variable z without changing the behavior of the program.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A _pure function_ is a function that is referentially transparent and has **no side effects**.\n",
    "- A few examples of program side effects would be: mutating the value of a variable, writing program data out to a file, inserting a row to a database, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Writing purely functional code can seem daunting, if you are coming from a purely object-oriented background. A good way to \n",
    "practice is to start writing code which prefers immutability, and switch to a mutable approach when dealing with I/O operations like \n",
    "network, database, or file interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of impure functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a couple of impure function examples.\n",
